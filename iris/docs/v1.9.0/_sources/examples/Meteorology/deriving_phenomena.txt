Deriving Exner Pressure and Air Temperature
===========================================

This example shows some processing of cubes in order to derive further related
cubes; in this case the derived cubes are Exner pressure and air temperature
which are calculated by combining air pressure, air potential temperature and
specific humidity. Finally, the two new cubes are presented side-by-side in a
plot.
