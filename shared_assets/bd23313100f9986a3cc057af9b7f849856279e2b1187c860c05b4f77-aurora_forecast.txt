Plotting the Aurora Forecast from NOAA on Orthographic Polar Projection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitors the
solar wind conditions using the ACE spacecraft orbiting close to the L1
Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system. This data is fed into the
OVATION-Prime model to forecast the probability of visible aurora at
various locations on Earth. Every five minutes a new forecast is
published for the coming 30 minutes. The data is provided as a
1024 by 512 grid of probabilities in percent of visible aurora. The
data spaced equally in degrees from -180 to 180 and -90 to 90.
