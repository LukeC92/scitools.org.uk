Ionosphere space weather
========================

This space weather example plots a filled contour of rotated pole point
data with a shaded relief image underlay. The plot shows aggregated
vertical electron content in the ionosphere.

The plot exhibits an interesting outline effect due to excluding data
values below a certain threshold.
