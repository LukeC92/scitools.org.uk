===============

This is the repository containing content found at scitools.org.uk.

Building content for scitools.org.uk
====================================

The content is generated by running the ``build.py`` script at the root of the
repository. ``build.py`` takes the content in ``source`` and ``templates`` and
constructs the resulting html. Both source and build content are stored in this
repository.


Adding built docs
-----------------

The html in this repository is a combination of generated and static content.
Running the ``build.py`` script will overwrite any static content which shares
a directory structure to that found in ``source``. The built documentation for
documentation such as Iris and cartopy are not generated from the ``source``
directory, and are instead generated with sphinx as a separate step. To add
further released version documentation, create the appropriate folder
(e.g. iris/docs/v1.2.3) with the built documentation (typically created via
sphinx). Once the content is in place, consider running
``tools/symlink_common.py .`` which will look through all files and share any
common assets into the shared_assets folder, thus reducing the overall
repository size.


###Example workflow

To update scitools.org.uk so that it includes the Iris documentation for the
Iris 1.12.0 release the following steps need to be followed.

1. Build the Iris documentation using sphinx.
```
$ cd <path_to_iris_repo>/docs/iris
$ make html
$ cp -a build/html/ <path_to_scitools.org.uk_repo>/iris/docs/v1.12.0
```

2. Update the `latest` symlink.
```
$ cd <path_to_scitools.org.uk_repo>
$ ln -s iris/docs/v1.12.0 iris/docs/latest
```

3. Update "Latest" and "Previous releases" in `source/iris/documentation.html`.

4. Run the ``build.py`` script.
```
$ python build.py
```

5. Generate the shared_assets.
```
$ python tools/symlink_common.py .
```


Adding contributors
-------------------

``contributors.json`` contains a JSON dictionary of all contributors who have
signed the scitools CLA. It is the definitive source (as rendered in
scitools.org.uk/about.html) of such contributors, and is where core developers
will look when considering whether a PR is ready for merging. If you've signed
the CLA and aren't yet on this list, please consider submitting a PR to speed
the process up.
