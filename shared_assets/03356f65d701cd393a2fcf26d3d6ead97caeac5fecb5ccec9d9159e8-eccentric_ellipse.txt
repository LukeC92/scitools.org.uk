Displaying data on an eccentric ellipse
---------------------------------------

This example demonstrates plotting data on an eccentric ellipse. The data
plotted is a topography map of the asteroid Vesta. The map is actually an
image, which is defined on an equirectangluar projection relative to an
ellipse with a semi-major axis of 285 km and a semi-minor axis of 229 km.
The image is reprojected on-the-fly onto a geostationary projection with
matching eccentricity.
